            <h1>Decoding the James Webb Space Telescope</h1>
            <p>The James Webb Space Telescope was originally known as the Next Generation Space Telescope and has been
                in development for over 30 years. The project has been delayed multiple times, especially since 2018.
                Here is a look at the development history to the successor, but not the replacement of Hubble.

                <h2>Origins</h2>
                <p>In 1989, the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, and NASA co-hosted the
                    Next
                    Generation Space Telescope Workshop at STScI, where engineers and astronomers debated the science
                    and
                    technical capabilities of an observatory that would follow the Hubble Space Telescope. Discussions
                    from that
                    workshop led to the formal recommendation in 1996 that the telescope should operate in infrared
                    wavelengths
                    and be equipped with a mirror larger than 4 meters.</p>
                <p>Construction on Webb began in 2004. In 2005, the European Space Agency’s Centre Spatial Guyanais
                    (CSG) spaceport in French Guiana was chosen as the launch site and an Ariane 5 rocket as the launch
                    vehicle. By 2011, all 18 mirror segments were finished and proven through testing to meet required
                    specifications.</p>

                <h2>The Telescope Range</h2>
                <p>The James Webb Space Telescope is the largest and most
                    powerful space science telescope ever built.
                    It will unfold the universe, transforming how we think about the night sky and our place in the
                    cosmos. The
                    telescope lets us look back to see a period of cosmic history never before observed. Webb can peer
                    into the
                    past because telescopes show us how things were – not how they are right now. It can also explore
                    distant
                    galaxies, farther away than any we’ve seen before..</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The James Webb Space Telescope is a large, infrared-optimized space telescope. Webb will find the
                    first galaxies that
                    formed in the early Universe, connecting the Big Bang to our own Milky Way Galaxy. Webb will peer
                    through dusty clouds
                    to see stars forming planetary systems, connecting the Milky Way to our own Solar System. Webb's
                    instruments are
                    designed to work primarily in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum, with some
                    capability in the visible
                    range.</p>

                <h2>The Lagrange (L2) point orbit</h2>
                <p>This L2 orbit allows one side of Webb’s sunshield to always face the Sun, Earth, and Moon, blocking
                    their
                    heat and light from reaching the telescope’s heat-sensitive optics. Webb’s month-long journey takes
                    it to the
                    second Lagrange (L2) point, one of five positions in space where the gravitational pull of the Sun
                    and Earth balances
                    the centripetal force required for a spacecraft to move with them.</p>

                <p>Once launched, Webb undergoes an action-packed six-month commissioning period, during which it fully
                    deploys, cools down to operating temperatures, aligns its mirrors, and calibrates its instruments.

                    the European
                    contribution to the mission. The Ariane 5 is one of the world's most reliable launch vehicles

                    It is beneficial for launch sites to be located near the equator - the spin of the Earth can help
                    give an additional
                    push.</p>
